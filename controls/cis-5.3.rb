  desc "This setting will record failed authentication attempts for SQL Server logins to
the SQL 
Server Errorlog. This is the default setting for SQL Server. 
Historically, this setting has been available in all versions and editions of
SQL Server. Prior 
to the availability of SQL Server Audit, this was the only provided mechanism
for 
capturing logins (successful or failed)."
  desc "rationale", "Capturing failed logins provides key information that can be used to
detect\\confirm 
password guessing attacks. Capturing successful login attempts can be used to
confirm 
server access during forensic investigations, but using this audit level setting
to also 
capture successful logins creates excessive noise in the SQL Server Errorlog
which can 
hamper a DBA trying to troubleshoot problems. Elsewhere in this benchmark, we 
recommend using the newer lightweight SQL Server Audit feature to capture both 
successful and failed logins."
  desc "check", "EXEC xp_loginconfig 'audit level';   
A config_value of failure indicates a server login auditing setting of Failed
logins only. 
If a config_value of all appears, then both failed and successful logins are
being logged. 
Both settings should also be considered valid, but as mentioned capturing
successful logins 
using this method creates lots of noise in the SQL Server Errorlog."

1.1.1.11 GUI Method 
 
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio. 
2. Right click the target instance and select Properties and navigate to the
Security 
tab. 
3. Select the option Failed logins only under the Login Auditing section and
click OK. 
4. Restart the SQL Server instance. 
1.1.1.12 T-SQL Method 
 
1. Run: 
EXEC xp_instance_regwrite N'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE', 
N'Software\\Microsoft\\MSSQLServer\\MSSQLServer', N'AuditLevel', 
REG_DWORD, 2 
2. Restart the SQL Server instance."
  desc "impact", "At a minimum, we want to ensure failed logins are captured in order to detect if
