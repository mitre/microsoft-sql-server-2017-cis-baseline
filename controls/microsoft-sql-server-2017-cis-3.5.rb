Administrator (Manual)"
  desc "The service account and/or service SID used by the MSSQLSERVER service for a
default 
instance or MSSQL$<InstanceName> service for a named instance should not be a
member of 
the Windows Administrator group either directly or indirectly (via a group).
This also 
means that the account known as LocalSystem (aka NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM) should not
be 
used for the MSSQL service as this account has higher privileges than the SQL
Server service 
requires."
  desc "rationale", "Following the principle of least privilege, the service account should have no
more 
privileges than required to do its job. For SQL Server services, the SQL Server
Setup will 
assign the required permissions directly to the service SID. No additional
permissions or 
privileges should be necessary."
  desc "check", "Verify that the service account (in case of a local or AD account) and service
SID are not 
members of the Windows Administrators group."
  desc "fix", "In the case where LocalSystem is used, use SQL Server Configuration Manager to
change 
to a less privileged account. Otherwise, remove the account or service SID from
the 
Administrators group. You may need to run the SQL Server Configuration Manager
if 
  
 
underlying permissions had been changed or if SQL Server Configuration Manager
was 
not originally used to set the service account."
  desc "impact", "The SQL Server Configuration Manager tool should always be used to change the
SQL 
Server's service account. This will ensure that the account has the necessary
privileges. If 
the service needs access to resources other than the standard Microsoft defined
directories 
and registry, then additional permissions may need to be granted separately to
those 
resources."

Administrators 
group."
