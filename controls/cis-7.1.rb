deprecated 
and should no longer be used in SQL Server: DES, DESX, RC2, RC4, RC4_128. 
Many organizations may accept the Triple DES algorithms (TDEA) which use keying
options 
1 (3 key aka 3TDEA) or keying option 2 (2 key aka 2TDEA). In SQL Server, these
are referred 
to as TRIPLE_DES_3KEY and TRIPLE_DES respectively. Additionally, the SQL Server 

algorithm named DESX is actually the same implementation as the TRIPLE_DES_3KEY 

option. However, using the DESX identifier as the algorithm type has been
deprecated and 
its usage is now discouraged."
