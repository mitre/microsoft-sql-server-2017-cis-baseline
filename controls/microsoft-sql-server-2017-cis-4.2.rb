  desc "impact", "This is a mitigating recommendation for systems which cannot follow the
recommendation 
to use only Windows Authenticated logins. 
Regarding limiting this rule to only logins with sysadmin and CONTROL SERVER
privileges, 
there are too many cases of applications that run with less than sysadmin level
privileges 
that have hard-coded passwords or effectively hard-coded passwords (whatever is
set the 
first time is nearly impossible to change). There are several line-of-business
applications 
that are considered best of breed which have this failing. 
Also, keep in mind that the password policy is taken from the computer's local
policy, 
which is taken from the Default Domain Policy setting. Many organizations have a
different 
password policy regarding the service accounts. These are handled in AD by
setting the 
account's password to not expire and having some other process track when the
password 
needs to be changed. With this second control in place, this is perfectly
acceptable from an 
audit perspective. If you treat a SQL Server login as a service account, then
you have to do 
the same. This ensures that the password change happens during a communicated 
downtime window and not arbitrarily."
  desc "default_value", "CHECK_EXPIRATION is ON by default when using SSMS to create a SQL authenticated
login.
